Terminator Plugins
==================
## About
You will find different plugins for the terminal emulator Terminator in this repository.
Some of them are written by me, most of them are not.


## Installation

1. Put files in `~/.config/terminator/plugins/`:

        mkdir -p ~/.config/terminator/plugins
        cp plugin.py ~/.config/terminator/plugins/


2. Restart [Terminator](http://www.tenshu.net/p/terminator.html), go to `Context menu > Preferences > Plugins` and select the new plugin.
